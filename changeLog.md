# Change Log S1.1
## index.py
- More or less copypaste from the IE 172 Repo
- index.py's app.layout contains the functions `create_header()` and `create_footer()` that are self-explanatory. The `html.Div()` after `dcc.Location()`
- In `displaypage(pathname)`, path names are added for the navbar elements (Adopt, Meet the Rescues, Contact Us, etc.)
- the home.layout and other pages do not appear for some reason
